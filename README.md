# NODE CALCULATOR

Decided to go with the tokenizer method to build the calculator, building tokenizers and calculation functions into classes.

### Running the app
- First pull the repository `git clone https://github.com/sonoftheweb/node-calc.git && cd node-calc`
- Run the app in terminal `node index.js`
